# SPOTIFY API LIMITATION - IMPORTANT NOTE

## What Happened

When collecting data from the Spotify API, we encountered a **403 Forbidden error** when trying to access the `audio_features` endpoint.

## Root Cause

The Spotify Web API's `/audio-features` endpoint requires **additional permissions** beyond standard Client Credentials OAuth flow. This endpoint has restricted access and is typically only available to:
- Spotify partners with special agreements
- Internal Spotify applications
- Users with extended API access

## What We CAN Get (Successfully Collected)

✅ **Track Metadata:**
- Track names
- Artists
- Album information  
- Duration
- **Popularity scores** (0-100)
- Spotify URLs
- Release dates

## What We CANNOT Get (Restricted)

❌ **Audio Features:**
- Danceability
- Energy
- Valence (musical positivity)
- Tempo
- Key
- Acousticness
- Instrumentalness
- Speechiness
- Liveness

## Impact on Analysis

This is a **realistic constraint** that professional data scientists encounter. Our project now demonstrates:

1. **Adaptability**: Working with available data rather than giving up
2. **Transparency**: Documenting limitations clearly
3. **Alternative Approaches**: Pivoting to focus on what we CAN measure

## Updated Analysis Focus

Instead of correlating audio features with TikTok virality, we will:

### Approach 1: Popularity-Based Analysis
- Correlate Spotify **popularity scores** with TikTok performance
- Analyze which songs have high Spotify popularity
- Compare popularity trends across cast recordings

### Approach 2: Qualitative Analysis
- Manually categorize songs by type (ballad, upbeat, ensemble, etc.)
- Analyze content themes and emotional content
- Study lyrical themes that resonated on TikTok

### Approach 3: TikTok-Centric Analysis
- Deep dive into TikTok metrics themselves
- Analyze content types, trends, and viral moments
- Study the social/cultural factors behind virality

## Professional Value

**This limitation actually STRENGTHENS the portfolio project** because it shows:
- Real-world problem-solving
- Transparency about data limitations
- Ability to pivot and find alternative solutions
- Professional documentation of constraints

## For Future Reference

To access audio features, one would need:
1. Apply for Spotify for Developers Extended API access
2. Use a Spotify Partner agreement
3. Use third-party music analysis tools (e.g., Essentia, librosa)
4. Manually analyze songs using music theory knowledge
