## Quick Start (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Get Spotify API Credentials (5 min)
1. Go to https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard
2. Log in or create account
3. Click "Create App"
4. Fill in:
   - App name: "Wicked TikTok Analysis"
   - Description: "Analyzing musical theatre viral potential"
   - Redirect URI: http://localhost:8888/callback
5. Copy Client ID and Client Secret
6. Edit `spotify_config.py` and replace placeholders

### Step 2: Run Setup (5 min)
```bash
cd /Users/isfarbaset/Documents/wicked-tiktok-analysis
./setup.sh
```

This will:
- Create a Python virtual environment
- Install all dependencies (pandas, spotipy, plotly, scikit-learn, etc.)
- Set up directory structure

### Step 3: Collect Data (5 min)
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
cd scripts

# Collect Spotify audio features
python 01_collect_spotify_data.py

# Create TikTok data template (uses example data)
python 02_collect_tiktok_data.py

# Run pattern analysis
python 03_analyze_patterns.py
```

## What Each Script Does

### Script 1: Spotify Data Collection
**File**: `01_collect_spotify_data.py`

**What it does**:
- Connects to Spotify API
- Collects audio features for all Wicked songs:
  - Energy, danceability, valence, tempo
  - Acousticness, speechiness, loudness
  - Duration, popularity, release date
- Also collects comparison data from:
  - Hamilton
  - The Greatest Showman
  - Frozen Broadway
  - Mean Girls
  - Six

**Output**:
- `data/spotify/wicked_audio_features.csv` (~15 songs)
- `data/spotify/comparison_musicals.csv` (~60+ songs)

### Script 2: TikTok Data Collection
**File**: `02_collect_tiktok_data.py`

**What it does**:
- Creates a template for manual TikTok data collection
- Generates example data based on real trends
- Provides detailed instructions for collecting actual data
- Creates content type reference guide

**Output**:
- `data/tiktok/tiktok_collection_template.csv`
- `data/tiktok/wicked_tiktok_performance_EXAMPLE.csv`
- `data/tiktok/content_type_reference.csv`
- `data/tiktok/INSTRUCTIONS.txt`

**Note**: Example data is provided so you can run the full pipeline immediately. For a real analysis, you'd manually collect actual TikTok data.

### Script 3: Pattern Analysis
**File**: `03_analyze_patterns.py`

**What it does**:
- Merges Spotify audio features with TikTok performance
- Calculates virality scores for each song
- Analyzes correlations between audio features and virality
- Identifies content type performance patterns
- Finds surprise hits (songs that defied expectations)
- Generates key insights

**Output**:
- `data/processed/merged_analysis.csv`
- `outputs/tables/feature_correlations.csv`
- `outputs/tables/content_type_performance.csv`
- `outputs/tables/key_insights.csv`

**Sample Findings** (from example data):
- Defying Gravity: 287,000 videos, 850M views
- Energy/Danceability show strongest correlation
- Vocal showcases performed best
- "What Is This Feeling?" was surprise hit (comedy format)

## Key Features

### Wicked Color Theme
All visualizations use authentic Wicked colors:
- **Emerald Green**: #00A86B (Elphaba)
- **Pink**: #E91E8C (Glinda)
- **Gold**: #FFD700 (Emerald City)
- **Light Green**: #90EE90
- **Dark Green**: #006B3F

### Analysis Methods
- **Spearman Correlation**: Rank-based, captures non-linear relationships
- **Pearson Correlation**: Linear relationships
- **Virality Score**: Composite metric combining:
  - Video count (50%)
  - Total views (30%)
  - Trending duration (20%)

### Data Quality
- Real Spotify audio features (automated via API)
- Example TikTok data based on actual trends
- Template for collecting your own TikTok data
- Fully reproducible analysis

## Portfolio Value

This project demonstrates:

1. **API Integration**: Spotify Web API with authentication
2. **Data Collection**: Automated + manual hybrid approach
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Correlation, feature importance
4. **Data Merging**: Combining multiple data sources
5. **Pattern Discovery**: Finding unexpected insights
6. **Documentation**: Professional README, inline comments
7. **Reproducibility**: Requirements, setup scripts, clear instructions
8. **Domain Knowledge**: Musical theatre + social media virality
9. **Creative Problem-Solving**: Working around TikTok API restrictions

## Next Steps (Optional Extensions)

### 1. Add Visualization Script (Script 4)
Create 7 interactive visualizations:
- Virality ranking bar chart
- Feature correlation heatmap
- Energy vs danceability scatter plot
- Content type performance
- Feature importance
- Timeline analysis
- Expected vs actual comparison

### 2. Add Machine Learning Model (Script 5)
- Train Random Forest model on Wicked data
- Extract feature importance
- Predict virality for other musicals
- Cross-validate model performance

### 3. Create Quarto Report
- Professional HTML report
- Embedded visualizations
- Executive summary
- Methodology section
- Key findings and recommendations

### 4. Collect Real TikTok Data
- Follow instructions in `data/tiktok/INSTRUCTIONS.txt`
- Search each song on TikTok
- Record video counts, trends, content types
- Replace example data with real data

## Troubleshooting

### "Import spotipy could not be resolved"
This is expected before running setup.sh. The virtual environment will install all packages.

### "No module named 'spotify_config'"
Make sure you're in the `scripts/` directory when running the scripts, or edit the import path.

### "Invalid client credentials"
Double-check your CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET in spotify_config.py. Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes.

### "FileNotFoundError: wicked_audio_features.csv"
Run Script 1 first to collect Spotify data before running Script 2 or 3.

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **pandas**: Data manipulation
- **numpy**: Numerical computing
- **spotipy**: Spotify API client
- **scipy**: Statistical functions
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning models
- **plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **matplotlib/seaborn**: Static plots

### Python Version
- Requires Python 3.8+
- Tested on Python 3.10

### Data Size
- Wicked: ~15 songs
- Comparison musicals: ~60 songs
- Total analysis dataset: ~75 songs
- Processing time: < 5 minutes

## Project Philosophy

This is a **retrospective analysis**, not a prediction project. We're analyzing what DID happen (real TikTok data) to understand what ACTUALLY drives virality, rather than predicting what MIGHT happen.

Key questions answered:
1. Which Wicked songs went most viral?
2. What audio features correlate with viral success?
3. Did high-energy songs win, or did ballads surprise us?
4. What role did celebrity influence play?
5. What content formats drove virality?

## License & Usage

- Adapt it for other musicals
- Extend it with additional features
- Share it on LinkedIn, GitHub, etc.
